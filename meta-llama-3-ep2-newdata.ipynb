The common room 1 connects to the storage, master room, common room 2, living room. Can we have a storage ? The storage should be at the south west corner of the apartment. The storage should be approx 10 sqft with the aspect ratio of 14 over 11. The storage should be next to the common room 1, master room, living room. Can you make a master room ? Place master room at the south side of the apartment. Make master room about 200 sqft with the aspect ratio of 9 over 14. The master room should have an en-suite bathroom. The master room attaches to the common room 1, storage, common room 2, living room. Make a common room 2 . The common room 2 should be at the north side of the apartment. Can you make common room 2 around 100 sqft with the aspect ratio of 3 over 5? The common room 2 should have an en-suite bathroom. The common room 2 should be next to the common room 1, master room, living room, kitchen, bathroom. Can you make a living room ? The living room should be about 250 sqft with the aspect ratio of 1 over 2. Can you make a kitchen ? I would like to place kitchen at the north side of the apartment. Can we have kitchen to be approx 150 sqft with the aspect ratio of 9 over 14? The kitchen connects to the common room 2. The bathroom should be considered. Place bathroom at the north side of the apartment. Can we have bathroom to be approx 50 sqft with the aspect ratio of 3 over 8? The bathroom is in an en-suite bathroom. The bathroom connects to the common room 2. \\n### Response:\\n<svg width=\"256\" height=\"256\"><rect data-category=\"common room 1\" x=\"82\" y=\"35\" width=\"45\" height=\"69\"><rect

Ensure rooms are positioned and sized according to the instructions.\\n\\n### Instruction:\\nMake a common room 1 . The common room 1 should be at the south side of the apartment. It would be great to have common room 1 approx 200 sqft with the aspect ratio of 9 over 14. The common room 1 should have an en-suite bathroom. The common room 1 connects to the storage, master room, common room 2, living room. Can we have a storage ? The storage should be at the south west corner of the apartment. The storage should be approx 10 sqft with the aspect ratio of 14 over 11. The storage should be next to the common room 1, master room, living room. Can you make a master room ? Place master room at the south side of the apartment. Make master room about 200 sqft with the aspect ratio of 9 over 14. The master room should have an en-suite bathroom. The master room attaches to the common room 1, storage, common room 2, living room. Make a common room 2 . The common room 2 should be at the north side of the apartment. Can you make common room 2 around 100 sqft with the aspect ratio of 3 over 5? The common room 2 should have an en-suite bathroom. The common room 2 should be next to the common room 1, master room, living room, kitchen, bathroom. Can you make a living room ?

Can we have kitchen to be approx 150 sqft with the aspect ratio of 9 over 14? The kitchen connects to the common room 2. The bathroom should be considered. Place bathroom at the north side of the apartment. Can we have bathroom to be approx 50 sqft with the aspect ratio of 3 over 8? The bathroom is in an en-suite bathroom. The bathroom connects to the common room 2. \\n###
